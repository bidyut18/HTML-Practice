            Cherry blossoms, also known as sakura in Japan, are the small, delicate pink flowers produced by cherry
            blossom trees. The springtime bloom is a lavish spectacle but remarkably brief; after only two weeks, they
            drop to the ground and wither, falling like snow with the ebb and flow of the winds. As flowers native to
            Asia, they can also be found in China, South Korea and India, but today they enjoy worldwide blooming.Tied
            to the Buddhist themes of mortality, mindfulness and living in the present, Japanese cherry blossoms are a
            timeless metaphor for human existence. Blooming season is powerful, glorious and intoxicating, but
            tragically short-lived — a visual reminder that our lives, too, are fleeting

    <section class="Section-C">
        <div class="box1">A cherry blossom is a flower of many trees of genus Prunus. The most well-known species is the
            Japanese cherry, Prunus serrulata, which is commonly called sakura (桜 or 櫻; さくら) </div>
        <div class="box2"> Somei-yoshino is a cultivar of sakura tree made in Japan. Its scientific name is Cerasus x
            yedoensis (Matsum.) A.V.Vassil.
            Somei-yoshino have grown all over in Japan ever since the Meiji period. When the news announces the sakura
            has started blooming, they use the somei-yoshino variety as the standard.</div>
        <div class="box3"> Sakura is known for its many varities that influence the change of petals, the size and color
            of the flowers, amount of fruit, and so on. This natural variation has also helped the creation of the many
            hybrid varities. </div>
